# Verivox Project

This repository contains a set of commands and configurations for managing a Verivox project. The project includes building a Docker image, running a Docker container, and performing tests.

## Prerequisites

Before using these commands, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node.js Package Manager)

## Usage

## API DOCS

http://localhost:3000/api-docs/

### Build Docker Image

Build a Docker image for the Verivox project using the following command:

```bash
make build
```

This command creates a Docker image with the name `verivox_proj`.

### Run Docker Container

Run a Docker container based on the previously built image using the following command:

```bash
make run
```

This command starts a Docker container, mapping port 3000 from the container to port 3000 on your host machine.

### Run Tests

Execute tests for the Verivox project using the following command:

```bash
make run-test
```

This command runs tests using Jest.

### Stop and Remove Docker Container

Stop and remove the Docker container using the following command:

```bash
make stop
```

This command stops and removes the Docker container named `verivox_proj`.

### Clean Up Docker Images and Containers

Clean up Docker images and containers, including stopping the container and removing the image, using the following command:

```bash
make clean
```

This command stops and removes the Docker container, followed by removing the Docker image named `verivox_proj`.
